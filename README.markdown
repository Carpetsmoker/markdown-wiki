Really simple document system.

- Documents are written in markdown (markdown parser used is
  [kramdown][kramdown])
- All documents are stored on the filesystem, you can edit them through the
  webinterface, or directly on the filesystem.
- Version is tracked with a VCS; curently `hg` and `git` are supported.
- It's just ~128 lines of code. Simple. Just worksâ„¢

The author of the program uses it to keep track of TODO lists, recipes, personal
documentation/cheatsheets on various things... You can use it for anything,
really.


Installation
------------
- Install dependencies with  [bundler][bundler]:

      bundle install


- You will need to initialize a `user` file and a VCS repository in `data/`;
  running `./install` is the easiest way to do that.

- Start it:

     ./mdweb.rb

  Or with a port number:

	 ./mdweb.rb -p 4568
